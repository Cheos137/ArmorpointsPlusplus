# ArmorPoints-Plusplus
A small Minecraft mod that allows you to see more than 20 armor points and let you stack your health onto one bar (and much more).

Mod source code.
See folders for individual Minecraft version ports.
See additional branches for legacy versions.

There is a feature-complete description of this mod over on the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/armorpoints) or [Curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armorpoints) of this mod and thus I won't write anything detailed here.
