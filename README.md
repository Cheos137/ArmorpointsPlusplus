# ArmorPoints-Plusplus
A small Minecraft mod that allows you to see more than 20 armor points and let you stack your health onto one bar.

v2 source code.
See additional branches for different versions of Minecraft.

There is a feature-complete description of this mod over on the [Curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armorpoints) of this mod and thus I won't write anything detailed here.
